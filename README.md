# OpenCVision
Face detection and recognition using OpenCV

## Purpose of this project
The aim of this project is to use Java AWT and OpenCV on Mac platform for face detection and recognition. The approach for Windows is available almost everywhere but for Mac platform it is a bit difficult to find. For this I will be noting down all the approaches I have taken to build the libraries and the JAR from OpenCV source code which then I used to create the application.

## Ingredients
You would need to first download the following, as required.

1. OpenCV Source (For this we are using version 3.2.0)  
   http://opencv.org/releases.html
2. Ant (Download only if Ant is not present)  
   https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
3. CMake (Download the DMG)
